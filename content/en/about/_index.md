## I'm Matheus Paiva! Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Software Engineer by profession and a problem solver by vocation.

On my carrer, I had the chance to work for incredible companies, from a big media corp in Latin America ([Globo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/globo/)) to startups on many funding stages, in ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil and ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Holland.

On all of them, I strived to create solutions that fit product needs (budget, performance & time), creating pieces of software for the long run, and most importantly, collaborate and rely heavily on other people to tailor the best possible solutions.

When Iâ€™m not working, I love eating good food, spend time with my loved ones and play around with my dog.

If you want to know more about my background, check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-paiva-29193879/) or drop me a line and say [hello](mailto:matheus.a.paiva@gmail.com?Subject=Hello+Matheus+Paiva).
