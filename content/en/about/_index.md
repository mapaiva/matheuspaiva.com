## I'm Matheus Paiva! Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Software Engineer by profession and a problem solver by vocation.

On my carrer, I had the chance to work for incredible companies, from a big media corp in Latin America ([Globo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/globo/)) to startups on many funding stages, in ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil and ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Holland.

On all of them, I endeavored to create solutions that fit product needs (budget, performance & time), creating pieces of software for the long run, and most importantly, collaborate and rely heavily on other people to tailor the best possible solutions.

If you want to know more about my background, check out my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matheus-paiva-29193879/) or drop me a line and say [hello](mailto:matheus.a.paiva@gmail.com?Subject=Hello+Matheus+Paiva).
