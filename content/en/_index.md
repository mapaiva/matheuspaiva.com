Hi, I'm Matheus Paiva, Software Engineer at [Roads](https://www.roads.run/) and Computer Engineer graduated from [FIAP](https://www.fiap.com.br/).

## Work

I had the chance to work for incredible companies, from startups on many funding stages to big corporations in two different countries. 

On all of them, I endeavored to create solutions that fit product needs (budget, performance & time), creating pieces of software for the long run, and most importantly, collaborate and rely heavily on other people to tailor the best possible solutions.
