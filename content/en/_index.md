Hi, I'm Matheus Paiva, Software Engineer at [Roads](https://www.roads.run/) and a Computer Engineer graduated from [FIAP](https://www.fiap.com.br/).

I’m responsible for designing, maintaining, and improving distributed software, making methods and processes of giants like Google and Microsoft within reach for companies of all sizes.

When I’m not working, I love eating good food, spend time with my loved ones and play around with my dog.
