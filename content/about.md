# Hey, everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matheus Paiva. I'm a Software Engineer focusing on web development and Computer Engineer graduated from [FIAP](https://www.fiap.com.br/).

## This blog

I started this personal blog to create a digital tech portfolio but ends up, I have the most fun writing rather than marketing myself.

I donâ€™t know the future of it, but right now, I really want to share stories about how it is to be a tech developer, my victories and mistakes throughout the software craftsmanship process, and how me, as a human being witness life itself.

## Work

I had the chance to work for incredible companies, from a big media corp in Latin America ([Globo](https://www.linkedin.com/company/globo/)) to startups on many funding stages, in Brazil and Holland.

On all of them, I strived to create solutions that fit product needs (budget, performance & time), creating pieces of software for the long run, and most importantly, collaborate and rely heavily on other people to tailor the best possible solutions.

## Life

When I'm not working, I love eating good food, spend time with the people I love, play around with my dog and writing about tech.
