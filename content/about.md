# Hi, I'm Matheus Paiva! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about technology and people. I believe that an environment that combines purpose, motivation, and results is key to success.

Extensive experience in building software, software delivery processes, product delivery, prioritizing roadmaps based on business strategy, negotiating with stakeholders, and influencing decision-making.

Graduated in Computer Engineering, I've worked in startups to large media companies in Brazil and the Netherlands. I've been involved in building various digital products from scratch to large-scale media delivery projects (BBB, Globoplay).

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer @ [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/)!
