# Hi, I'm Matheus Paiva! 👋

I’m passionate about technology and people, and I believe that an environment that combines purpose, motivation, and results is key to success.

I have extensive experience in building software, optimizing software delivery processes, managing product delivery, prioritizing roadmaps based on business strategy, negotiating with stakeholders, and influencing decision-making.

A graduate of Computer Engineering, I’ve worked in environments ranging from startups to large media companies in Brazil and the Netherlands. I’ve been involved in building various digital products from scratch and in large-scale media delivery projects (like BBB and Globoplay).

Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer @ [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/)!
